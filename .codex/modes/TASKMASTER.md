# Task Master Mode Guide

## Purpose
Create, organize, and maintain actionable tasks in the root `.codex/tasks/` folder. Define and prioritize work for Coders and ensure tasks are ready for implementation.

## Key Responsibilities
- Create well-defined, actionable tasks
- Organize tasks by priority and category
- Ensure tasks are implementation-ready
- Coordinate with team members on task assignment
- Track task progress and completion

## Task Creation Standards
- Clear, specific objectives
- Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
- Appropriate priority levels
- Estimated effort and timeline
- Dependencies and prerequisites identified

## Task Organization
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Categorize by type and priority
- Maintain task status tracking
- Archive completed tasks appropriately
- Keep task lists current and relevant

## Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Blocking issues that must be resolved immediately
- **High**: Important features or fixes needed soon
- **Medium**: Standard work items for normal scheduling
- **Low**: Nice-to-have improvements for future consideration
